                        <p>Lesson 5 is decks and deck building. We will begin with the basics of what makes up a deck. A deck is a minimum of 60 cards. 
                            You are also limited to 4 cards of the same name in a deck with the exception of basic lands. For example we can’t have more than 4 cards named “Almighty Brushwagg” in our deck.  
                            In a perfect world you want your deck to synergize and have cards combo with other cards in your deck. This can be by playing a tribal deck which means all of your creatures are 
                            one specific type and you have cards that give those types buffs or enhance their power. You could also have a spell slinger deck which just wants to cast as many instants and 
                            sorceries as possible and get bonuses off their casts. Another objective of your deck is to give you the cards you need when you need them. This can be accomplished by having multiple 
                            cards that do generally the same thing. For example you can have 2 cards that both kill a creature but are named differently. A good rule of thumb is to try to have as few cards as possible 
                            while being over the minimum. The less cards you have the better your odds of drawing the winning card. There are plenty of websites out there to help you on your deck building. </p>
